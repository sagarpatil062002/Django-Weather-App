# Django Weather App

A simple Django application that fetches and displays current weather information for a specified city using the OpenWeatherMap API. Enter a city name to view temperature, weather description, humidity, feels-like temperature, wind speed, and visibility. To use, replace the `api_key` variable in `views.py` with your OpenWeatherMap API key.

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repo and navigate to the project directory.
2. Install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the server with `python manage.py runserver` and open `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.
